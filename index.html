        <p>Today, I focus on my recent visit to LongHorn and the fantastic food service I experienced. It was Father's Day and we went to LongHorn to celebrate. The waitress was very kind, was able to serve us in a very timely manner, and was very attentive to our needs.</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td><p>My order was a New York Strip, medium well, with a side of fries and house salad. It was a nice and juicy with just the right amount of seasoning. The fires were a nice complement to the steak and were very well prepared. Great food and service for a good price.</p></td>
